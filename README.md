# Space-Image-of-the-Day-NASA-APOD-API-

API: APIs provide an interface for machines to talk with each other. NASA’s APIs allow developers to use NASA’s data, such as imagery, for application development.

NASA gathers a lot of data - over 15 Terabytes per day! And by a White House mandate this data is free to the public - in a format useful to you. This is where the APIs come into play. Figuring out the best way to distribute, use, and reuse NASA’s data is a problem. NASA’s APIs provide a solution by lowering the barrier of entry to people outside NASA to easily manipulate and access the public information.

A list of NASA APIs beginning with the Astronomy Picture Of The Day (APOD) can be found here. Here are some of the APIs available:
1) Near Earth Object Web Service (NeoWs): Access to near Earth asteroid information.
2) Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC): Full disc imagery of the Earth.
3) Earth Observatory Natural Event Tracker (EONET): Prototype web service providing continously updated natural event metadata, such as storm imagery, gathered from the Earth’s surface.
4) NASA Image and Video Library: Access to the NASA Image and Video Library.
5) Sounds (beta): Access to space sounds via SoundClound with some of the hassle abstracted away.

This project uses the NASA A Picture of the day API to show a new picture of space daily with its information.
