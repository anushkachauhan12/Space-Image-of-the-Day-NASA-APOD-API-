        <b>API:</b> APIs provide an interface for machines to talk with each other. NASA’s APIs allow developers to use NASA’s data, such as imagery, for application development. <br><br>


        NASA gathers a lot of data - over 15 Terabytes per day! And by a White House mandate this data is free to the public - in a format useful to you. This is where the APIs come into play.
        Figuring out the best way to distribute, use, and reuse NASA’s data is a problem. NASA’s APIs provide a solution by lowering the barrier of entry to people outside NASA to easily manipulate and access the public information.<br><br>
        A list of NASA APIs beginning with the Astronomy Picture Of The Day (APOD) can be found here. Here are some of the APIs available:<br>

        <u><b>1) Near Earth Object Web Service (NeoWs):</b></u> Access to near Earth asteroid information.<br>
        <u><b>2) Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC):</b></u> Full disc imagery of the Earth.<br>
        <u><b>3) Earth Observatory Natural Event Tracker (EONET):</b></u> Prototype web service providing continously updated natural event metadata, such as storm imagery, gathered from the Earth’s surface.<br>
        <u><b>4) NASA Image and Video Library:</b></u> Access to the NASA Image and Video Library.<br>
        <u><b>5) Sounds (beta):</b></u> Access to space sounds via SoundClound with some of the hassle abstracted away.<br>
